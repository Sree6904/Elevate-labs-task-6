K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Classification

## Objective
Implement and visualize KNN classification using the Iris dataset.

## Tools Used
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas, Matplotlib
- StandardScaler for normalization

## What I Did
- Loaded the Iris dataset and encoded class labels.
- Normalized feature values.
- Trained KNN models with different values of `K`.
- Evaluated model performance using accuracy and confusion matrix.
- Visualized decision boundaries using the first 2 features.

## Results
- Best accuracy achieved at K=3.
- Decision boundary clearly separates the 3 Iris species in 2D.
